Real-Time OCR System for Digit Recognition
Objective
To develop a deep learning-based system that recognizes digits from real-time inputs, such as a camera feed, using Optical Character Recognition (OCR). The system will:

Detect and recognize digits in real-time.
Display the recognized digits.
Provide metrics on accuracy and recognition speed.
Steps to Develop the System
1. Data Preparation
Dataset: Utilize the MNIST dataset, containing 70,000 labeled images of handwritten digits (0-9), ideal for digit recognition.
Preprocessing:
Normalize images from the dataset.
Resize images if necessary.
Ensure real-time feed undergoes similar preprocessing steps (e.g., converting to grayscale, resizing).
2. Model Selection
CNN Architecture:
Use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), effective for image classification tasks.
Start with a simple CNN architecture like LeNet, designed for digit recognition. Consider using a deeper network for improved accuracy.
Framework:
Choose between TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch:
TensorFlow/Keras: Easier for beginners with more abstraction.
PyTorch: Offers flexibility and control over the training loop.
3. Model Training
Train the CNN on the MNIST dataset.
Evaluate the model's accuracy on the test set to ensure generalization.
Fine-tune hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, number of epochs) to enhance accuracy.
4. Real-Time OCR System
Video Capture: Use OpenCV to capture real-time video from a camera, processing each frame.
Preprocessing: Convert each frame to grayscale, binarize, and segment the digits.
Digit Recognition: Pass the preprocessed image of each detected digit through the trained CNN model to predict the digit.
Display Output: Utilize OpenCV functions to overlay recognized digits on the video stream in real-time.
5. Performance Metrics
Accuracy: Evaluate recognition accuracy on a real-time test set, including the percentage of correctly classified digits.
Speed (Latency): Measure the time taken to process each frame and predict digits, ensuring efficient real-time performance on available hardware.
